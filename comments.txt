Tyler's Comments on Homeworks

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Great job, but I'm not sure where you came up with
the approach of the function which generates the random data using
sapply. Can you explain? (just type below and I'll see your response
next time!)

2016.10.22 - HW5 and HW6 - Hi Asher, thanks for submitting something. I understand the last two weeks have been busy. Keep your head up! ... or down, in the books... you get the drift.

2016.11.05 - HW7 and HW8 - Looks good! If at some point you write up
your paper, I'd be interested to take a look!

2016.11.28 - HW9 - Great job, I see you were having issues with the sums of
squares... the RSS will be non-zero and the variance in yi is going to
contribute to the magnitude. Ah, I just found a missing parentheses. You are
only averaging one term in beta_0, so if you add parentheses around the whole
thing, you get the right answer. You can see this when you increase N, beta 0
does not converge to the right value. The RSS is still large, but like I said,
this is a measure of variance, not centrality. I added some lines to your work
so check that out.
