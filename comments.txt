2016.10.03 - HW4 - Great job, but I'm not sure where you came up with
the approach of the function which generates the random data using
sapply. Can you explain? (just type below and I'll see your response
next time!)

2016.10.22 - HW5 and HW6 - Hi Asher, thanks for submitting something. I understand the last two weeks have been busy. Keep your head up! ... or down, in the books... you get the drift.

2016.11.05 - HW7 and HW8 - Looks good! If at some point you write up
your paper, I'd be interested to take a look!
